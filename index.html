                The <span id="noun1">KID</span> went to the grocery store. They were sent there by their parents to <span id="verb1">BUY</span> healthy fruits and <span id="pluralNoun1">VEGETABLES</span>. First they went to the produce section. They looked at <span id="adjective1">RED</span> apples, yellow bananas, and orange <span id="pluralNoun2">CARROTS</span>, but then they had a better idea! They <span id="verb2">WALKED</span> to the candy aisle and carefully studied all the sweet options. After much deliberation, they grabbed a <span id="adjective2">BIG</span> chocolate bar, colorful jelly beans, and long gummy worms.
                <br><br>
                After using <span id="noun2">MONEY</span> from their parents to buy the candy, they walked to the bus stop. They unwrapped the chocolate bar while waiting for the bus. They opened the bag of jelly beans while riding the bus. They started <span id="verb3">EATING</span> the gummy worms when they got off the bus. The candy was all gone by the time they got home. Their parents asked them, "Where are the fruits and vegetables?" They shrugged and said, "My <span id="noun3">TUMMY</span> hurts."
